Edge of Universe - My first scenario in which I tried to make the game more enjoyable and restore the basic tutorial, along with basic missions. The starting planet is Navara I, so far I haven't found a way to put it first in order.
the planet is full of loot resorces and wrecks, you can also find CV wrecks and with a little bit of Luck Full not Damaged Capital Ship.
The other planet Omnicron, less resources but also supports the tutorial and basic missions.
